# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - DeepSpeech - Kabyle

This project develops a working Speech-To-Text module for kabyle language using [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech), that can be used for any audio processing pipeline. [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) toolkit based on [Baidu's Deep Speech](https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/deep_speech3_12_17.pdf) research paper. DeepSpeech project uses Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to make the implementation easier.
